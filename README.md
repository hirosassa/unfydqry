# unfydqry

> 🌐 日本語版: [docs/ja/README.md](docs/ja/README.md)

A shared full-text search engine usable from both iOS (SwiftData) and Android (Room).
A single search core written in **Rust + UniFFI** is consumed as a SwiftPM package on
iOS and as a Gradle module on Android.

Design rationale lives in [`docs/cross-platform-search-engine-design.md`](docs/cross-platform-search-engine-design.md) (日本語版: [`docs/ja/cross-platform-search-engine-design.md`](docs/ja/cross-platform-search-engine-design.md)).

## What it does

- **Pluggable behaviour**: the host binding picks a *normalization profile* and a *search algorithm*, and the engine combines them. Both implementations live in one Rust core, so any chosen combination behaves identically on iOS and Android — see [Configuring behaviour](#configuring-behaviour).
- **Fuzziness axes that get folded** (default `loose` profile): case, full-width / half-width, kana variant (katakana ↔ hiragana).
- **Dakuten / handakuten are kept distinct** (`か` and `が` are different keys).
- **Default search** is a SQLite FTS5 + trigram index ranked by `bm25`; substring, prefix, suffix, all-terms, and fuzzy (trigram / Levenshtein / Damerau-Levenshtein) algorithms are also selectable.
- Searches return only the stable `id` and a score; the host re-fetches records from its source-of-truth store.
- Because the logic lives in **one Rust implementation**, iOS and Android behaviour matches by construction, not by convention.

## Platform guides

Per-platform setup, quick-usage snippets, native-artifact builds, test layout,
and release flow each live in a dedicated guide. The cross-platform sections
below (behaviour configuration, the `spec/` test contract) apply to every
binding.

| Platform | Guide | Library |
|---|---|---|
| iOS (Swift) | [`docs/ios.md`](docs/ios.md) | `import UnifiedQuery` (SwiftPM) |
| Android (Kotlin) | [`docs/android.md`](docs/android.md) | `io.github.0x0c:unifiedquery` (Gradle / Maven Central) |
| Flutter (Dart) | [`docs/flutter-plugin.md`](docs/flutter-plugin.md) | `unfydqry` (Dart package, Git dependency) |

## Configuring behaviour

`SearchEngine` has five constructors. The **combination is chosen on the binding side**; every implementation lives in the Rust core (`core/src/normalize/`, `core/src/search/`), so the choice can never make iOS and Android diverge.

- `SearchEngine(dbPath:)` — the default combination, `loose` + `trigram_bm25`. Unchanged from before, so existing callers keep working.
- `SearchEngine.withConfig(dbPath:, config:)` — pick a normalization **profile** and the search algorithm. Reopening an index under a *different* profile is an error (see below).
- `SearchEngine.withConfigRebuilding(dbPath:, config:)` — same as `withConfig`, but a normalization change regenerates the index in place instead of erroring (see [Regenerating the index](#regenerating-the-index-after-a-normalization-change)).
- `SearchEngine.withOptions(dbPath:, config:)` — like `withConfig`, but selects normalization with a composable `NormalizeOptions` set (see below) instead of a named preset.
- `SearchEngine.withOptionsRebuilding(dbPath:, config:)` — `withOptions` + in-place regeneration on a normalization change.

### Normalization profiles (`NormalizeProfile`)

The profile is applied identically at index time and query time.

| Profile | Pipeline | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `loose` (default) | NFKC → katakana→hiragana → lowercase | Case, width, and kana variant all fold together — `ﾄｳｷｮｳ`, `トウキョウ`, `とうきょう` collapse to one key. |
| `nfkc_case_fold` | NFKC → lowercase | Width and case fold, but **kana variants stay distinct** (`トウキョウ` ≠ `とうきょう`). |

Both profiles keep dakuten / handakuten distinct (`か` ≠ `が`).

### Composable normalization steps (`NormalizeOptions`)

For finer control, `withOptions` takes a `NormalizeOptions` set: NFKC is always applied as the foundation, and any of the following steps can be toggled on top. The two profiles above are just named presets — `loose` = `{lowercase, kana_fold}`, `nfkc_case_fold` = `{lowercase}`.

| Step | Effect |
|---|---|
| `lowercase` | Case fold via `char::to_lowercase`. |
| `kana_fold` | Katakana → hiragana (`カ` → `か`); dakuten stays distinct. |
| `fold_diacritics` | Strip Latin/Western combining marks (`café` → `cafe`); Japanese voiced marks are preserved. |
| `fold_choonpu` | Fold the prolonged-sound mark after kana (`サーバー` ≡ `サーバ`). |
| `expand_iteration_marks` | Expand iteration marks (`時々` → `時時`, `こゞ` → `こご`). |
| `normalize_hyphens` | Unify the dash/hyphen family (`‐ – — −` …) to ASCII `-`. |
| `strip_digit_grouping` | Remove digit-grouping commas (`1,000` → `1000`). |
| `collapse_whitespace` | Collapse whitespace runs to a single space and trim. |

The enabled steps run in a fixed canonical order (`NFKC → expand_iteration_marks → kana_fold → fold_choonpu → lowercase → fold_diacritics → normalize_hyphens → strip_digit_grouping → collapse_whitespace`), so any combination is deterministic and identical on iOS and Android.

> The active normalization is fingerprinted into the index's `meta` table. The two presets keep their historical keys (`loose` / `nfkc_case_fold`); any other combination derives a canonical `nfkc+…` key. Reopening an existing index under a *different* fingerprint throws `ConfigMismatch` rather than silently returning wrong results — regenerate the index to switch (see below). (An index created before this field existed is treated as `loose`.)

### Regenerating the index after a normalization change

The engine stores each document's **raw text** alongside its normalized form, so the index can be regenerated in place when the profile (or its underlying rules) changes — the host does not re-feed documents.

- **Explicit** — call `reindex()` on an open engine. It re-normalizes every stored document under the engine's current profile, rewrites the index, and re-stamps the profile fingerprint. Returns the number of documents regenerated.
- **Automatic on open** — `SearchEngine.withConfigRebuilding` / `withOptionsRebuilding` open the index and, when the stored fingerprint differs from the requested one, run the same regeneration before returning instead of throwing `ConfigMismatch`.

> Documents indexed before raw-text retention existed have no raw text to re-normalize and are left untouched by a regeneration.

### Search algorithms (`SearchStrategy`)

Every algorithm runs against the already-normalized text and returns `(id, score)`.

| Strategy | Matches | How | Score | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `trigram_bm25` (default) | the whole query as a phrase, anywhere in the text | FTS5 trigram index + `bm25()` | bm25 relevance (lower = more relevant) | General-purpose **ranked** full-text search. |
| `substring` | the query anywhere in the text | `LIKE '%q%'` | `0.0` (unranked) | "Contains" matching where short (1–2 char) queries must also hit and ranking doesn't matter. |
| `prefix` | text that **starts with** the query | `LIKE 'q%'` | `0.0` (unranked) | Type-ahead / autocomplete suggestions. |
| `suffix` | text that **ends with** the query | `LIKE '%q'` | `0.0` (unranked) | "Ends-with" matching (e.g. file extensions, honorific suffixes). |
| `all_terms` | docs containing **every** whitespace-separated term, in any order | `LIKE '%t%'` AND-ed per term | `0.0` (unranked) | Multi-word queries where word order is irrelevant (unlike `substring`, which needs the literal run including spaces). |
| `fuzzy_trigram` | docs whose character-trigram set is similar enough to the query (Jaccard ≥ threshold) | trigram set similarity, computed in Rust | `1 − similarity` (lower = more similar; exact = `0.0`) | Typo tolerance without a full edit-distance scan. |
| `levenshtein` | docs with a word within an edit-distance threshold of the query | min Levenshtein distance to any word, in Rust | edit distance (lower = better) | Typo-tolerant matching of a single word/term. |
| `damerau_levenshtein` | same as `levenshtein`, but an adjacent transposition counts as one edit | min OSA distance to any word, in Rust | edit distance (lower = better) | Typo tolerance that also forgives swapped neighbouring characters (`tokoy` ↔ `tokyo`). |

Notes:
- **Ranked** strategies are `trigram_bm25` (by bm25), `fuzzy_trigram` (by similarity), and `levenshtein` / `damerau_levenshtein` (by distance). `substring`, `prefix`, `suffix`, and `all_terms` are unranked (constant `0.0`, storage order) — use `limit` to cap results.
- `trigram_bm25` cannot match queries shorter than 3 characters, so those automatically fall back to a substring `LIKE` (score `0.0`).
- The fuzzy strategies need no extra index, crate, or SQLite extension: trigram sets and edit distances are computed in Rust over the normalized text (per Unicode codepoint, so Japanese compares correctly). The edit-distance threshold scales with query length (1 edit per 4 characters, minimum 1).

### Selecting a combination

The combination is chosen on the binding side — see the per-language calls in the [iOS](docs/ios.md#selecting-a-combination), [Android](docs/android.md#selecting-a-combination), and [Flutter](docs/flutter-plugin.md) guides.

To inspect normalization directly there are also free functions: `normalizeLoose(input)` (always the `loose` profile), `normalizeWithProfile(input, profile)`, and `normalizeWithOptions(input, options)` for a composable step set.

## Build

### Prerequisites
- Rust stable (via rustup)
- macOS + Xcode 26+ (for the iOS side)
- Android NDK r29+ and the Android SDK (for the Android side)
- JDK 17+ (for Gradle)

### Rust core only
```sh
cd core
cargo test --all-targets         # unit + conformance
cargo build --release
```

### Benchmarks

The Rust core includes [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) benchmarks covering search, indexing, and normalization. All benchmarks use an in-memory SQLite database with deterministically generated Japanese text.

```sh
cd core

# Run all benchmarks
cargo bench

# Run a specific benchmark suite
cargo bench --bench search       # search strategies (8 strategies × 3 corpus sizes × 3 query lengths)
cargo bench --bench index        # bulk index, single append, and reindex
cargo bench --bench normalize    # normalization profiles and individual steps

# Filter to a specific group or case
cargo bench -- "search/trigram_bm25"
cargo bench -- "index/bulk"
cargo bench -- "normalize/profile"
```

After the first run, Criterion saves baseline results under `core/target/criterion/`. Subsequent runs compare against the baseline and report regressions. HTML reports are generated at `core/target/criterion/report/index.html`.

### Platform builds

Building the native artifacts (XCFramework / `.so`) and the sample apps is
covered per platform:

- iOS (XCFramework + Xcode sample) — [`docs/ios.md#build-swiftpm--xcode-sample`](docs/ios.md#build-swiftpm--xcode-sample)
- Android (`.so` via cargo-ndk + Gradle sample) — [`docs/android.md#build-gradle-sample`](docs/android.md#build-gradle-sample)
- Flutter — [`docs/flutter-plugin.md#building-native-artifacts`](docs/flutter-plugin.md#building-native-artifacts)

### Sample apps

Both sample apps (`ios/sample`, `android/sample/app`) demo the same UX so the
two platforms can be eyeballed side by side:

- A standard search field with **incremental search** (debounced ~150 ms); an
  empty query lists every seeded document.
- A **settings modal** (SwiftUI `.sheet` / Compose `ModalBottomSheet`) with a
  toggle per `NormalizeOptions` step, the search-algorithm picker, and an
  **index-regeneration** button. Flipping a step regenerates the index in place
  via `withOptionsRebuilding`, so results update without re-feeding documents.
- The same seed corpus on both platforms, chosen to exercise each step (kana /
  width / case folding, diacritics, chōonpu, iteration marks, hyphens, digit
  grouping) so the effect of toggling a step is visible.

## Tests

Three runners — `cargo test` (Rust), `swift test` (Swift Testing), and
`gradle :unifiedquery:test` (JUnit 5 on JVM) — execute the same behavioural
contract against the same Rust core. Each CI workflow runs independently and
all three must stay green.

### Where every kind of test lives

The suite is split into **four layers**, one purpose per layer. The same
layering is reproduced on every platform — when a new platform is added it
should follow exactly the same shape (see *Adding a new platform* below).

| Layer | Lives in | What it covers | What it does **not** cover |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Rust unit | `core/src/normalize/` & `core/src/engine.rs` (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`) | Internal logic of the Rust core — has access to private items. | Anything that needs the FFI layer. |
| 2. Spec-driven (cross-platform) | `spec/*.json` + per-platform loader | Pure `(input → expected)` and `(ops → ids)` cases shared by all runners. Drift in the Rust core fails the **same `id`** in all three CIs at once. | Property/inequality assertions, performance smoke, filesystem lifecycle, score sanity — none of these reduce to a plain equality on a value. |
| 3. Native lifecycle | `*LifecycleTests` per platform | Opening / reopening / persisting / invalid-path on the language's actual I/O and error types. | Search behaviour. |
| 4. Native query (non-data-driven) | `*QueryTests` / `*Tests` per platform | bm25 ordering, `limit` honouring, score sanity (`0.0` for LIKE, finite-nonzero for FTS5), non-throwing safety on FTS5 specials, concurrency smoke. | Anything expressible as `(input → expected)` — that belongs in `spec/`. |

The principle: **if an assertion is a plain equality on a value, put it in
`spec/`. Everything else stays in the native suite.** The spec README
([`spec/README.md`](spec/README.md)) keeps the canonical list of what is and
isn't in scope.

### Running tests

| Runner | Command | What it loads |
|---|---|---|
| Rust unit | `cd core && cargo test --lib` | `core/src/normalize/` & `core/src/engine.rs` `#[cfg(test)]` modules |
| Rust conformance | `cd core && cargo test --test conformance` | `core/tests/conformance.rs` → `../spec/*.json` |
| Rust (all) | `cd core && cargo test --all-targets` | both of the above (matches CI) |
| Swift Testing | `swift test` | `ios/Tests/UnifiedQueryTests/*.swift` (the `SpecLoader` walks up from `#filePath` to find `spec/`) |
| JUnit 5 (JVM) | `cd android/sample && gradle :unifiedquery:test` | `unifiedquery/src/test/kotlin/.../*.kt` (gets `unfydqry.spec.dir` from `build.gradle.kts`) |

### The `spec/` directory

`spec/normalize.json` and `spec/search.json` are the **single source of truth
for cross-platform behaviour**. Schema, conventions (versioning, `id`,
`description`, scope rules) and intent are documented in
[`spec/README.md`](spec/README.md). In short:

- Every file is versioned (`"version": 1`). Loaders refuse to run if it
  doesn't match the version they were written for — a future breaking schema
  change cannot silently make tests pass by loading nothing.
- Every case carries a stable snake-case `id` and a human-readable
  `description`. Loaders must include both in every failure message so a CI
  log alone is enough to diagnose the break.
- `normalize.json` is a flat list of `(input, expected)` cases.
- `search.json` has two sections: `scenarios` (a sequence of `ops` followed by
  `assertions`) and `seeded_matrices` (one shared seed reused across many
  queries — cheaper than re-seeding per query).
- Hit-id comparisons are **order-insensitive** (set equality). Order is
  asserted only by the native query suites, against bm25.

### Per-platform test files

The native (lifecycle + query) test files for each binding are listed in its
guide — iOS in [`docs/ios.md#tests`](docs/ios.md#tests), Android in
[`docs/android.md#tests`](docs/android.md#tests). Both follow the same
four-layer split as the Rust core below.

Rust (`core/`):

| File | Layer | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `src/normalize/mod.rs` `mod tests` | 1 — unit | Trace table from design doc §2.2; dakuten/handakuten distinctness; `nfkc_case_fold` keeps kana distinct. |
| `src/engine.rs` `mod tests` | 1 — unit | Index / remove / re-index / LIKE fallback / quote escaping / empty query; `prefix` & `substring` strategies; `ConfigMismatch` on profile change; `reindex()` count and `withConfigRebuilding` regeneration. |
| `tests/conformance.rs` | 2 — spec-driven | Same `spec/*.json` as Swift and Kotlin, asserted directly on the in-process Rust API. Catches core drift independently of either binding. |

The native query/lifecycle layer is intentionally **not** mirrored in the
Rust integration tests — the Rust core has no FFI-specific lifecycle to
exercise (no Swift `FileManager`, no JNA loader), and the bm25/ordering
properties are covered by Swift+Kotlin which exercise the same code path.

### Adding a new platform

To bring up a new platform (e.g. Python via maturin, Node via napi-rs,
Flutter, Wasm/JS, .NET) the test suite should keep the same four layers.
Concretely:

1. **Generate the UniFFI binding** for the new language and commit it,
   following the same convention as Swift / Kotlin (binding co-located with
   the language's library module; FFI native lib loaded by the language's
   convention).
2. **Add a spec loader** for that language. It should:
   - Locate the repo's `spec/` directory (either via a build-system property
     like the Kotlin side, or by walking up from the test file like the
     Swift side, or via a relative path like the Rust integration test).
   - Decode both JSON files into typed structs that match
     [`spec/README.md`](spec/README.md) (`version`, `cases`,
     `scenarios`, `seeded_matrices`, `ops` as a tagged union of
     `index`/`remove`).
   - Assert `version == EXPECTED_VERSION` and refuse to run if it doesn't —
     this is what prevents a future schema bump from silently passing.
3. **Translate the four `Spec*` tests** (`normalize cases`, `scenarios`,
   `seeded_matrices`, plus the two `version` checks) into the language's
   parameterized-test idiom. Each case must surface `id` + `description` in
   the failure message — that's the load-bearing piece for cross-CI
   debugging.
4. **Translate the native layers** (lifecycle + query) by following the
   Swift/Kotlin pairs as templates. They are deliberately written as
   mirror images of each other so a third translation is straightforward.
   Keep the **scope boundary** from the table above: anything reducible to
   `(input → expected)` belongs in `spec/`, not here.
5. **Wire a GitHub Actions workflow** modelled on
   `.github/workflows/{swift,kotlin,rust}-tests.yml`. Trigger paths must
   include `core/**` and `spec/**` so any change to the core or the spec
   re-runs the new platform's CI too — this is what makes drift visible at
   the same time across all platforms.
6. **Extend `spec/`, not the native tests, when adding new behavioural
   coverage** that all platforms should share. A new case lands in JSON once
   and lights up in every CI on the next run.

A change that breaks the Rust core should fail with **the same case `id`**
on every platform simultaneously. If only one platform fails on a spec
case, the loader on that platform is wrong — not the core.

## Releasing

Two release workflows live in `.github/workflows/`:

| Artifact | Workflow | Trigger | Published to |
|---|---|---|---|
| iOS XCFramework | `release-xcframework.yml` | manual (tag input, e.g. `v0.1.0`) | GitHub Release asset (`UnifiedQuery.xcframework.zip`) |
| Android AAR | `release-aar.yml` | version tag (`X.Y.Z`) or manual dispatch | Maven Central (`:unifiedquery` AAR) |

Step-by-step release procedures are in each platform guide:

- iOS XCFramework — [`docs/ios.md#releasing-xcframework`](docs/ios.md#releasing-xcframework)
- Android AAR — [`docs/android.md#releasing-aar`](docs/android.md#releasing-aar)

## Namespace map

| Layer | Name |
|---|---|
| Rust crate | `unfydqry` |
| Rust lib | `libunfydqry.{a,so,dylib}` |
| UniFFI namespace | `unfydqry` |
| Swift FFI module | `unfydqryFFI` |
| SwiftPM package | `UnifiedQuery` |
| Android Gradle module | `:unifiedquery` |
| Kotlin package | `uniffi.unfydqry` |

## Advanced platform support

A **Flutter plugin** wraps the iOS and Android native bindings behind a Dart
method-channel API. It now lives in-tree under `flutter/` (Dart package
`unfydqry`) and its CI runs on `main` — see the Flutter Tests badge above. Full
docs are in [`docs/flutter-plugin.md`](docs/flutter-plugin.md).

| Runtime | Location | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| Flutter | `flutter/` (Dart package `unfydqry`) | [`docs/flutter-plugin.md`](docs/flutter-plugin.md) |

The plugin is **not** part of the iOS/Android distribution: it requires the
native artifacts (XCFramework + `.so`) to be built first and is intended for
teams already using Flutter.

```sh
# Dart unit tests (mock method channel, no native artifacts required)
cd flutter && flutter test

# Sample app (build the native artifacts first — see docs/flutter-plugin.md)
cd flutter/example && flutter run
```
