# unfydqry

> 🌐 日本語版: [docs/README.ja.md](docs/README.ja.md)

A shared full-text search engine usable from both iOS (SwiftData) and Android (Room).
A single search core written in **Rust + UniFFI** is consumed as a SwiftPM package on
iOS and as a Gradle module on Android.

Design rationale lives in [`docs/cross-platform-search-engine-design.md`](docs/cross-platform-search-engine-design.md) (Japanese).

## What it does

- **Fuzziness axes that get folded**: case, full-width / half-width, kana variant (katakana ↔ hiragana).
- **Dakuten / handakuten are kept distinct** (`か` and `が` are different keys).
- **SQLite FTS5 + trigram** index. Queries shorter than 3 chars fall back to `LIKE`.
- Searches return only the stable `id` and a `bm25` score; the host re-fetches records from its source-of-truth store.
- Because the logic lives in **one Rust implementation**, iOS and Android behaviour matches by construction, not by convention.

| | iOS | Android |
|---|---|---|
| Library | `import UnifiedQuery` (SwiftPM) | `implementation(project(":unifiedquery"))` |
| Generated binding | `ios/Sources/UnifiedQuery/UnifiedQuery.swift` | `android/sample/unifiedquery/src/main/kotlin/uniffi/unfydqry/unfydqry.kt` |
| FFI module | `unfydqryFFI` (via the modulemap inside the XCFramework) | `libunfydqry.so` loaded through JNA |
| Distributable | `ios/UnifiedQuery.xcframework` (arm64 device + arm64/x86_64 sim + arm64 mac) | `android/jniLibs/{arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a,x86_64}/libunfydqry.so` |

## Install

### iOS (Swift Package Manager)
Add the package using a tagged release:

```swift
// Package.swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/0x0c/unfydqry.git", from: "0.1.0")
```

The xcframework is **not** committed to Git. Two forms of `Package.swift`
co-exist:
- On `main` and in every PR, `Package.swift` references the xcframework by
  local path (`binaryTarget(path:)`). Local dev and the swift-tests CI build
  the xcframework into `ios/UnifiedQuery.xcframework` first and then run
  `swift test` against that local copy.
- On every release tag, `.github/workflows/release-xcframework.yml` rewrites
  `Package.swift` to `binaryTarget(url:checksum:)` pointing at the
  `UnifiedQuery.xcframework.zip` attached to that same GitHub Release, and
  tags the rewritten commit. SwiftPM consumers resolve the tag and see the
  URL form. `main` itself is never modified by the release workflow, so
  SwiftPM's manifest cache on dev machines stays consistent.

## Quick usage

### iOS (Swift)
```swift
import UnifiedQuery

let dbURL = FileManager.default
    .urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0]
    .appendingPathComponent("search_index.sqlite")
let engine = try SearchEngine(dbPath: dbURL.path)

try engine.index(id: 1, text: "Ｐｙｔｈｏｮ 入門")
let hits = try engine.search(query: "python", limit: 50)
// → [Hit(id: 1, score: -1.521)]
```

### Android (Kotlin)
```kotlin
import uniffi.unfydqry.SearchEngine

val engine = SearchEngine(filesDir.resolve("search_index.sqlite").absolutePath)

engine.index(1L, "Ｐｙｔｈｏｮ 入門")
val hits = engine.search("python", 50u)
// → [Hit(id=1, score=-1.521)]
```

## Build

### Prerequisites
- Rust stable (via rustup)
- macOS + Xcode 26+ (for the iOS side)
- Android NDK r29+ and the Android SDK (for the Android side)
- JDK 17+ (for Gradle)

### Rust core only
```sh
cd core
cargo test --all-targets         # unit + conformance
cargo build --release
```

### iOS (SwiftPM + Xcode sample)
```sh
# Build for all 4 Apple targets, regenerate the Swift binding, assemble the
# fat XCFramework, zip it for SwiftPM consumption, and print the binaryTarget
# checksum. Produces ios/UnifiedQuery.xcframework{,.zip,.zip.sha256}.
bash scripts/build-xcframework.sh

# Tests (Package.swift sees the local xcframework and uses it directly)
swift test

# Sample app
cd ios/sample
xcodegen generate                # project.yml → SearchSample.xcodeproj
open SearchSample.xcodeproj
```

### Android (Gradle sample)
```sh
# Generate the .so files via cargo-ndk and place them under jniLibs/
cd core
ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/path/to/ndk cargo ndk \
  -t arm64-v8a -t armeabi-v7a -t x86_64 \
  -o ../android/jniLibs build --release

# JVM unit tests (load the macOS arm64 dylib through JNA)
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-darwin
cd ../android/sample
gradle :unifiedquery:test

# Sample app
gradle :app:assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Tests

Three runners — `cargo test` (Rust), `swift test` (Swift Testing), and
`gradle :unifiedquery:test` (JUnit 5 on JVM) — execute the same behavioural
contract against the same Rust core. Each CI workflow runs independently and
all three must stay green.

### Where every kind of test lives

The suite is split into **four layers**, one purpose per layer. The same
layering is reproduced on every platform — when a new platform is added it
should follow exactly the same shape (see *Adding a new platform* below).

| Layer | Lives in | What it covers | What it does **not** cover |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Rust unit | `core/src/{normalize,engine}.rs` (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`) | Internal logic of the Rust core — has access to private items. | Anything that needs the FFI layer. |
| 2. Spec-driven (cross-platform) | `spec/*.json` + per-platform loader | Pure `(input → expected)` and `(ops → ids)` cases shared by all runners. Drift in the Rust core fails the **same `id`** in all three CIs at once. | Property/inequality assertions, performance smoke, filesystem lifecycle, score sanity — none of these reduce to a plain equality on a value. |
| 3. Native lifecycle | `*LifecycleTests` per platform | Opening / reopening / persisting / invalid-path on the language's actual I/O and error types. | Search behaviour. |
| 4. Native query (non-data-driven) | `*QueryTests` / `*Tests` per platform | bm25 ordering, `limit` honouring, score sanity (`0.0` for LIKE, finite-nonzero for FTS5), non-throwing safety on FTS5 specials, concurrency smoke. | Anything expressible as `(input → expected)` — that belongs in `spec/`. |

The principle: **if an assertion is a plain equality on a value, put it in
`spec/`. Everything else stays in the native suite.** The spec README
([`spec/README.md`](spec/README.md)) keeps the canonical list of what is and
isn't in scope.

### Running tests

| Runner | Command | What it loads |
|---|---|---|
| Rust unit | `cd core && cargo test --lib` | `core/src/{normalize,engine}.rs` `#[cfg(test)]` modules |
| Rust conformance | `cd core && cargo test --test conformance` | `core/tests/conformance.rs` → `../spec/*.json` |
| Rust (all) | `cd core && cargo test --all-targets` | both of the above (matches CI) |
| Swift Testing | `swift test` | `ios/Tests/UnifiedQueryTests/*.swift` (the `SpecLoader` walks up from `#filePath` to find `spec/`) |
| JUnit 5 (JVM) | `cd android/sample && gradle :unifiedquery:test` | `unifiedquery/src/test/kotlin/.../*.kt` (gets `unfydqry.spec.dir` from `build.gradle.kts`) |

### The `spec/` directory

`spec/normalize.json` and `spec/search.json` are the **single source of truth
for cross-platform behaviour**. Schema, conventions (versioning, `id`,
`description`, scope rules) and intent are documented in
[`spec/README.md`](spec/README.md). In short:

- Every file is versioned (`"version": 1`). Loaders refuse to run if it
  doesn't match the version they were written for — a future breaking schema
  change cannot silently make tests pass by loading nothing.
- Every case carries a stable snake-case `id` and a human-readable
  `description`. Loaders must include both in every failure message so a CI
  log alone is enough to diagnose the break.
- `normalize.json` is a flat list of `(input, expected)` cases.
- `search.json` has two sections: `scenarios` (a sequence of `ops` followed by
  `assertions`) and `seeded_matrices` (one shared seed reused across many
  queries — cheaper than re-seeding per query).
- Hit-id comparisons are **order-insensitive** (set equality). Order is
  asserted only by the native query suites, against bm25.

### Per-platform test files

iOS (`ios/Tests/UnifiedQueryTests/`):

| File | Layer | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SpecLoader.swift` | infrastructure | Decodes `spec/*.json` into Swift structs. Locates `spec/` from `#filePath` (no SwiftPM resources). |
| `SpecDrivenTests.swift` | 2 — spec-driven | Uses `@Test(arguments:)` to expand spec cases into one parameterized test each. |
| `NormalizeTests.swift` | 4 — native (normalize) | Inequality (`が ≠ か`), idempotency, long-input smoke. |
| `SearchEngineLifecycleTests.swift` | 3 — lifecycle | `:memory:`, file creation, reopen persistence, invalid-path throws, isolation between paths. |
| `SearchEngineQueryTests.swift` | 4 — native (query) | bm25 ordering, `limit`, score sanity, FTS5 special chars, concurrency smoke via `withTaskGroup`. |

Android (`android/sample/unifiedquery/src/test/kotlin/com/unfydqry/unifiedquery/`):

| File | Layer | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Spec.kt` | infrastructure | Decodes `spec/*.json` via Jackson. Reads `unfydqry.spec.dir` set by `build.gradle.kts`. |
| `SpecDrivenTest.kt` | 2 — spec-driven | `@ParameterizedTest` + `@MethodSource` mirrors the Swift expansion. |
| `NormalizeTest.kt` | 4 — native (normalize) | Same inequality / idempotency / long-input cases as Swift. |
| `SearchEngineLifecycleTest.kt` | 3 — lifecycle | Same shape as Swift, using `java.nio.file` and `SearchException`. |
| `SearchEngineQueryTest.kt` | 4 — native (query) | bm25 ordering, `limit`, score sanity, FTS5 special chars, concurrency via `ExecutorService`. |

Rust (`core/`):

| File | Layer | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `src/normalize.rs` `mod tests` | 1 — unit | Trace table from design doc §2.2; dakuten/handakuten distinctness. |
| `src/engine.rs` `mod tests` | 1 — unit | Index / remove / reindex / LIKE fallback / quote escaping / empty query. |
| `tests/conformance.rs` | 2 — spec-driven | Same `spec/*.json` as Swift and Kotlin, asserted directly on the in-process Rust API. Catches core drift independently of either binding. |

The native query/lifecycle layer is intentionally **not** mirrored in the
Rust integration tests — the Rust core has no FFI-specific lifecycle to
exercise (no Swift `FileManager`, no JNA loader), and the bm25/ordering
properties are covered by Swift+Kotlin which exercise the same code path.

### Adding a new platform

To bring up a new platform (e.g. Python via maturin, Node via napi-rs,
Flutter, Wasm/JS, .NET) the test suite should keep the same four layers.
Concretely:

1. **Generate the UniFFI binding** for the new language and commit it,
   following the same convention as Swift / Kotlin (binding co-located with
   the language's library module; FFI native lib loaded by the language's
   convention).
2. **Add a spec loader** for that language. It should:
   - Locate the repo's `spec/` directory (either via a build-system property
     like the Kotlin side, or by walking up from the test file like the
     Swift side, or via a relative path like the Rust integration test).
   - Decode both JSON files into typed structs that match
     [`spec/README.md`](spec/README.md) (`version`, `cases`,
     `scenarios`, `seeded_matrices`, `ops` as a tagged union of
     `index`/`remove`).
   - Assert `version == EXPECTED_VERSION` and refuse to run if it doesn't —
     this is what prevents a future schema bump from silently passing.
3. **Translate the four `Spec*` tests** (`normalize cases`, `scenarios`,
   `seeded_matrices`, plus the two `version` checks) into the language's
   parameterized-test idiom. Each case must surface `id` + `description` in
   the failure message — that's the load-bearing piece for cross-CI
   debugging.
4. **Translate the native layers** (lifecycle + query) by following the
   Swift/Kotlin pairs as templates. They are deliberately written as
   mirror images of each other so a third translation is straightforward.
   Keep the **scope boundary** from the table above: anything reducible to
   `(input → expected)` belongs in `spec/`, not here.
5. **Wire a GitHub Actions workflow** modelled on
   `.github/workflows/{swift,kotlin,rust}-tests.yml`. Trigger paths must
   include `core/**` and `spec/**` so any change to the core or the spec
   re-runs the new platform's CI too — this is what makes drift visible at
   the same time across all platforms.
6. **Extend `spec/`, not the native tests, when adding new behavioural
   coverage** that all platforms should share. A new case lands in JSON once
   and lights up in every CI on the next run.

A change that breaks the Rust core should fail with **the same case `id`**
on every platform simultaneously. If only one platform fails on a spec
case, the loader on that platform is wrong — not the core.

## Releasing a new iOS xcframework

The xcframework is shipped via GitHub Releases, not committed to Git. To cut a
new release:

1. Land all intended changes on `main`.
2. Open Actions → **Release XCFramework** → *Run workflow*, enter a tag like
   `v0.1.0`.
3. The workflow runs `scripts/build-xcframework.sh`, rewrites the
   `// --- BINARY-TARGET START/END ---` block in `Package.swift` to the URL +
   checksum form on a detached HEAD off of `main`, tags that commit with the
   version, pushes the tag (but not the branch), and publishes a Release with
   `UnifiedQuery.xcframework.zip` attached.

The tag commit's `Package.swift` is created by the same run that uploads the
asset, so SwiftPM consumers never see a tag whose checksum disagrees with the
attached zip. `main` is left unchanged.
